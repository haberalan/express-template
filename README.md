# express-template

This repository provides an Express template for user authentication, written in `typescript`, featuring essential packages like `bcrypt` for password hashing, `jsonwebtoken` for token-based authentication, `mongoose` for MongoDB interactions, and `nodemailer` for email services. It's designed for quick setup and scalability, including middleware for parsing requests, managing cookies, handling CORS, and processing images with `sharp`. Perfect for projects needing secure user management and authentication out of the box.

## Quick setup

You will have to create your own MongoDB database and add App password of your gmail account. Remember to add these data to the `.env` file (like in the `.env-example`).

Clone the repository and run the following commands:

```
npm install
```

That is all. Have fun using it!
